<h1>About<h1>
This observatory aims to make visible a part of the fake and unverified informations circulating online.<br>
Its goal is to help citizen to understand the mechanisms of rumors spreading and the fantasmatic ideas those fake informations people believe in.<br>
This website stands as an outsider in regard to the other websites specialised in rumors, which already exists on the Web, because it takes in consideration 3 points of view that usually are not compared. It does not only focus on the falseness of the rumors and the role played by the medias vehiculating those fake informations. But it also pays attention to the way people spread it on Twitter. And finally, it puts this phenomenom into perspective through a theorical approach : sociological, anthropological and journalistic texts, that are specially selected to shed light on the subject.<br>
This publication aims to make visible a part of the fake and unverified informations circulating online.<br>
It quotes the news and the online news articles which peddle those fake informations and the way it is spread by people on Twitter.<br>
Moreover, this publication puts those facts into perspective, through theorical texts : sociological, anthropological and journalistic analysis of rumors online, which contextualise this phenomenon, to look at this issue in a broader way and give it its historical background back.<br>
It clearly shows that the frontier between what we call “conventional information” and “unconventional information” is now really porous.<br>
This publication is made to be widely distributed. This can be read online, in a PDF or as a printed book.

The Post reported that Burton and a friend wanted to display Manson's body in a "bizarre California version of Lenin’s Tomb" in order to "draw huge crowds and make big money." (Burton and Manson's marriage license recently expired.) Gawker's Antiviral blog did a good job of unpacking the claim, noting that neither Burton nor Manson have commented, and that nothing currently backs up Simone's claim. It's also worth noting that Simone is seeking a publisher for his book, and making this claim has given him attention for the project.

The story also quotes Asim Qureshi, research director at the human rights group CAGE, as saying it's Emwazi. (He met with Emwazi before he left for Syria.)

It's entirely possible that the resort needed to do this again in 2014, however it's also possible that this is the recycling of a four year old story as new.

<div id="news108"><div class ="title">IBM will cut more than 110,000 jobs this week</div><div class ="description">Financial writer Robert X. Cringely made the claim in a blog post on Jan 22. for Forbes. He did not cite any sources for his information. He wrote that "next week about 26 percent of IBM’s employees will be getting phone calls from their managers." Cringely is not a Forbes staffer; he is one of the site's many freelance "contributors." This means his work may or may not have been vetted by editors at Forbes. Cringely is a veteran journalist and recently wrote an ebook about IBM. However, an unidentified IBM spokesperson responded by calling the claim "ridiculous" and "baseless." She added: "If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a mere fraction of what's been reported." We are keeping this as unverified since the claim has a lifespan of one week and it will be proven true or false by Friday. Correction: the headline of this claim initially said 11,000 rather than 110,000 jobs.</div><div class ="date">2015-01-26</div><div class="news_article"><div class ="origin">The rumor first appeared on:<br>http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertcringely/2015/01/22/next-weeks-bloodbath-at-ibm-wont-fix-the-real-problem/<br>Then, other websites peddled the rumor.

Media rumors
At first glance, it may seem paradoxical to talk together rumor and the media. In Indeed, the usual definitions of rumors relate to the emergence in the social body, information which precede or oppose a official sources (often called black market Information). In other words, information media, vertical, which spreads high down - those who "know" (the "right circles ") To those who do not know (the public) - opposes a parallel information, horizontal, between people: they are rumors. The information would be the voice of the media, the rumor would be that of group, spreading what the group believes to be true, towards and against official sources. But are we really sure that these phenomena, sociologically distinct, are the also psychologically, that is to say the perspective of information processing? Are we sure that the line between information and rumor is tight? No, and that for two reasons. The first is that the media, too, reflected the rumors, especially in the era of the Internet.
The information, particularly television, is subject to a double bind: to inform, a hand, that is to say to highlight a phenomenon in public debate, and seduce the other hand, stress commercial to attract the largest number possible to individuals. This second constraint required to be fast (especially to present the scoop before the others) does not always allow journalists to verify the information they collect, which explains a rumor can be relayed by the media. Furthermore, the constraint Trade requires information which sensation, so that rumors and news threats (security, food or medical) are easily disseminated. Add to this, the effects the media agenda and its inherent mimicry (The topics covered by the media are fundamentally the same), and contagion takes quickly.
The second reason that suggests that media sometimes information about the fashion rumor is that the mechanisms processing the information in the two cases are quite comparable. Consider, for example of how the media are relays legal or scientific concepts also complex as AIDS, the "cloud" of Chernobyl, Internet, mad cow disease, GMOs, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, bird flu. Since it is often new developments that burst into the landscape economic, social or political, information work requires a special effort to accurately communicate these new ideas.
However, it is sometimes more economical from the point of cognitive view (less tiring intellectually) search in memory if there is no "Something like it," and if it is possible to operate a kind of "transfer properties" an event that everyone knows about a new event.

The "transfer of ownership"
This reflex is already at work in children : an Italian study on social representation the Chernobyl cloud in children shows they sought to appropriate this strange novelty by comparing it to what they knew well : "It is a gas that is not a gas normal with which one can cook, it is a gas strange that is not good for health", says and Leonardo, aged ten.

We call these short heuristic reasoning and approximate that substitute for an argument long and methodical, or observation statistic to explain events .

These shortcuts are used to reach conclusions without having to deal with the problem of how depth. The media, too, resort to such heuristics when dealing events again. The result often takes the form Analog reconciliations. It is thus notes that any political court case US sees affix the gate suffix, then as well as the situations are not necessarily comparable Watergate: Iran-Contra, Monicagate, and more recently Erongate. In the same vein, we recently spoke of "intifada suburbs "about the violence that erupted in the cities.
In the case of GMOs, reference to mad cow is common. Le Nouvel Observateur headline in April 1996 "Alert crazy food" and Liberation in November 1996, "mad soy Alert". Examination of the press shows a tendency to systematically mention the "mad cow" in articles or reports on GMOs, "mad cow, GMOs ... Six out of ten French worried about their safety food. [...] While the cow crisis crazy full swing, the Council of State gave yesterday the green light to the cultivation of three varieties transgenic maize Syngenta Company ". We are witnessing in this case the transfer of ownership: BSE (Which itself was based on the tainted blood) has permeated the public of a danger deaf there a few years ago; GM probably the same property and this amalgam materialized by transferring a cow terminology crazy to GMOs. Thus, by sliding meaning that pass usually unnoticed, the notion of "crazy GMOs" takes shape in the media.

However, by dint of being drawn on the slope slippery fillings of this type, media obviously arouse anxiety in the public. We asked 188 students write a short editorial about GMOs.
Once eliminated the "words tools" (articles, pronouns, auxiliaries ...), the term of mad cow disease appears in thirteenth position. Spontaneously, 23.4 percent of the subjects mentioned cow crazy in a subject on GMOs. It is interesting to study the texts according to exposure subject to media information. We have divided subjects into three groups: those who follow "Rarely", "sometimes" and "often" news on GMOs. The first group is characterized by the adjective natural: "I do not like anything that is not natural. "The second group rather uses Under foods, dangerous and risks to them, what matters is whether the new foods are dangerous to health. The third group evokes scientists more and productivity: "The scientists claim that GMOs are a considerable progress "and" It are products of a will to productivity increased in the field of agriculture. "
However, the term mad cow is mentioned by nine percent of subjects saying follow only rarely news on GMOs (30 percent of subjects studied); it goes to 21 percent in those who follow "sometimes" (the most numerous: 47 percent of subjects); it is equal to 16 percent for those who follow "often or always" news (23 percent of subjects). So it seems that there is a relationship between exposure intensity information and the use of this heuristic Media: those who have limited exposure to the media there little use, unlike people follow the media a bit, but every day it which is the case of the majority of the population.
Thus occurs a transfer of properties of an object familiar (mad cow) to a strange object or new (GMOs), both in the public mind in the media, while the two problems have nothing in common, either biologically nor economically. But what unites them, it is the fear they generate.

<div class="theorie_bloc">       
<div class ="theorietitre">What's gossip?</div>
<div class="theorietexte">Conversational genre of moralistic and speculative talk about persons usually not present, the persons who engage in this talk, and the speech events of such interaction. Max Gluckman influenced its anthropological study by proposing rule-governed gossip and scandalizing as both hallmark and duty of small-group membership, functioning to bound struggles, maintain unity, and distinguish that group from others (Gluckman 1963). He acknowledges it as an art, but only more recent work has elaborated the performance and narrative skills required in this catalytic social process.
Because gossip deals informally and privately in particulars, personalities, and
personal relationships, it is often considered a form of resistance to dominant, official,
public culture—the province of those unable to address issues openly. Women are
popularly believed to be gossips, a definition first noted in 1566: “A person, mostly a
woman, of light and trifling character, esp. one who delights in idle talk; a newsmonger, a tattler” (Oxford English Dictionary [OED] ). However, in Old English godsibb meant “god-related,” ritually established relationships between godparents, while Middle English usage designated familiar acquaintances of either sex, especially a woman’s female friends invited to attend her at childbirth. Samuel Johnson gives as his third dictionary definition of gossip: “One who runs about tattling like women at a lying-in.”
By Victorian times, emerging male medical specialists forbade female gossips during
labor because they were too “noisy.” Certainly men, too, are gossips, and the gender, age, and social status of both gossipers and their subjects must be determined
ethnographically. Gossip as both negatively and positively valued conversation was recognized by 1811: “Idle talk; trifling or groundless rumour; tittle-tattle. Also, in a more favourable sense: Easy, unrestrained talk or writing, esp. about persons or social incidents” (OED). Scholars have viewed it as an informal means of teaching morality, maintaining social control and solidarity, managing reputations, negotiating covertly, exchanging information, expressing sociability itself, and entertainment. Gossip’s powerful, ambivalent potential may be seen, for example, in its association with both witchcraft and traditional healing, the latter to aid diagnosis and treatment of social factors in illness.
Jorg R. Bergmann claims its “equivocal- contradictory character” (publicly deplored,
privately practiced) stems from being “a structural part of private information” that
“violates the precept of discretion and respects it at the same time…insofar as a mutual friend is initiated into the secret and thereby a new secret created” (Bergmann 1993:149, 150, 152).
Until more ethnographic studies are undertaken, neither the universality of gossip nor
its variety can be assessed. Ethnographies of speaking gossip are problematic in both
fieldwork and presentation because the art of gossip—its performance and
ethnoaesthetics—is by nature private, elusive, and situationally specific. Still, like more publicly valued narrative forms such as myth, epic, and legend, gossip should be
considered significant storying that informs and enlivens social life in a range of groups.

Moreover, the strategy most often employed to counter rumors – directly confronting the rumor by repeating it, then debunking it – may serve to augment the fluency of the rumor, thereby decreasing the likelihood that citizens will definitely reject that rumor out of hand.
Citizens may accept “fluid” rumors, or they may say they are unsure about the veracity of those rumors, but they will be less likely to definitively reject them.

<div id="news168"><div class ="title">Seven underage Bosnian girls got pregnant on a school trip</div><div class ="description">The claim was first reported by InSerbia, an English language website based in Bosnia, on Dec. 17. Its story attributes the claim to "National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici." That person does not say anything specific about the girls. Subsequent media reports say that there were a total of 28 girls on the trip, but that is not mentioned in the original article. Nor does the article list the town the girls came from, or where the trip took place. Those details were in a Dec. 21 report from the Daily Mail, and have been cited by others. On Dec. 23, German tabloid Bild published an interview with Babici, who lives in Banja Luka. He repeated that the story is true, but noted that it did not happen recently and all the girls had had abortions. He would not say exactly when or where it happened, or whether it was on a trip to Sarajevo. The lack of specific details, the absence of a second source, and the lack of evidence, leads us to declare this claim unverified.</div><div class ="date">2014-12-23</div><div class="news_article"><div class ="origin">The rumor first appeared on:<br>http://inserbia.info/today/2014/12/bih-seven-primary-school-students-pregnant-after-five-day-excursion/<br>Then, other websites peddled the rumor.

They subsequently found a man who says he witnessed the filming of the video and that it was staged. Lin and the homeless man were in a car together before filming started, the witness said. Lin is a prankster, which made the video suspect form the start. Lin has said that he expects to hold one final public event with the man int he video to present him with the money being raised in an IndieGoGo campaign. We await that event to see if Lin changes his claim that it was not staged.

It's unclear whether the Mirror or CEN gathered them, or if they come from another source. The quotes also seem too perfect to have come from real interviews. In one example, an unnamed police official in Singapore supposedly said, "We don't condone vigilante activity but in this case it seems to have turned out OK."
