None of the French press reports describe him as a lead investigator. His connection to the Charlie Hebdo case is an afterthought in reports. 2. A police union rep said that Freou had been suffering from depression and burnout. His suicide did not come completely out of nowhere. 3. A little more than a year earlier he had discovered the body of a colleague who committed suicide. 4. It's possible but unconfirmed that his mental state plus his colleague's suicide combined with the Charlie Hebdo incident to help pushing him over the edge, of course.

It quotes Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda saying that the adoption has nothing to do with the werewolf legend.  “The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,” he said. The president's tweets and blog post about the ceremony also say nothing about werewolves, and she had previously adopted other seventh children. Argentinian media reports about the adoption also say nothing about werewolves. The news was that he was the first Jewish presidential godson. For example, there is this report from Argentinian media: http://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/cristina-es-madrina-por-primera-vez-de-un-ahijado-judio Finally, there is a legend in Europe about seventh sons and werewolves, and families would often get someone to be a godparent to that child to ward off the transformation. But it is not connected to the Argentinian legend of werewolves.
