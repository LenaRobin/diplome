<h1>About<h1>
This observatory aims to make visible a part of the fake and unverified informations circulating online.<br>
Its goal is to help citizen to understand the mechanisms of rumors spreading and the fantasmatic ideas those fake informations people believe in.<br>
This website stands as an outsider in regard to the other websites specialised in rumors, which already exists on the Web, because it takes in consideration 3 points of view that usually are not compared. It does not only focus on the falseness of the rumors and the role played by the medias vehiculating those fake informations. But it also pays attention to the way people spread it on Twitter. And finally, it puts this phenomenom into perspective through a theorical approach : sociological, anthropological and journalistic texts, that are specially selected to shed light on the subject.<br>
This publication aims to make visible a part of the fake and unverified informations circulating online.<br>
It quotes the news and the online news articles which peddle those fake informations and the way it is spread by people on Twitter.<br>
Moreover, this publication puts those facts into perspective, through theorical texts : sociological, anthropological and journalistic analysis of rumors online, which contextualise this phenomenon, to look at this issue in a broader way and give it its historical background back.<br>
It clearly shows that the frontier between what we call “conventional information” and “unconventional information” is now really porous.<br>
This publication is made to be widely distributed. This can be read online, in a PDF or as a printed book.
