<h1>About<h1>
This observatory aims to make visible a part of the fake and unverified informations circulating online.<br>
Its goal is to help citizen to understand the mechanisms of rumors spreading and the fantasmatic ideas those fake informations people believe in.<br>
This website stands as an outsider in regard to the other websites specialised in rumors, which already exists on the Web, because it takes in consideration 3 points of view that usually are not compared. It does not only focus on the falseness of the rumors and the role played by the medias vehiculating those fake informations. But it also pays attention to the way people spread it on Twitter. And finally, it puts this phenomenom into perspective through a theorical approach : sociological, anthropological and journalistic texts, that are specially selected to shed light on the subject.<br>
This publication aims to make visible a part of the fake and unverified informations circulating online.<br>
It quotes the news and the online news articles which peddle those fake informations and the way it is spread by people on Twitter.<br>
Moreover, this publication puts those facts into perspective, through theorical texts : sociological, anthropological and journalistic analysis of rumors online, which contextualise this phenomenon, to look at this issue in a broader way and give it its historical background back.<br>
It clearly shows that the frontier between what we call “conventional information” and “unconventional information” is now really porous.<br>
This publication is made to be widely distributed. This can be read online, in a PDF or as a printed book.

It was attributed to journalist Daniel Simone, who is working on a book about Manson. The Post reported that Burton and a friend wanted to display Manson's body in a "bizarre California version of Lenin’s Tomb" in order to "draw huge crowds and make big money." (Burton and Manson's marriage license recently expired.) Gawker's Antiviral blog did a good job of unpacking the claim, noting that neither Burton nor Manson have commented, and that nothing currently backs up Simone's claim. It's also worth noting that Simone is seeking a publisher for his book, and making this claim has given him attention for the project. This is Unverified until evidence emerges either way."</div><div class ="date">"T"</div></div><div class="news_article"><div class ="origine">"http://nypost.com/2015/02/08/charles-mansons-fiancee-wanted-to-marry-him-for-his-corpse-source/"</div><div class="article"></div></div><div class="news_twitter"><div class ="share">"217587"</div><div class="twitter_bloc"></div></div>

It was claimed that "Arab and foreign surgeons were hired [to do the harvesting], but prohibited from mixing with local doctors."

The claim remains Unverified because British and U.S. intelligence officials have refused to confirm or deny it, and as of now there is no conclusive evidence linking Emwazi to the videos. A New York Times report said that the "story was confirmed by a senior British security official," but did not offer a name. CBS news also cited an unnamed official to say the name is correct.

Cringely made the claim in a blog post on Jan 22. for Forbes. He did not cite any sources for his information. He wrote that "next week about 26 percent of IBM’s employees will be getting phone calls from their managers." Cringely is not a Forbes staffer; he is one of the site's many freelance "contributors." This means his work may or may not have been vetted by editors at Forbes. Cringely is a veteran journalist and recently wrote an ebook about IBM. However, an unidentified IBM spokesperson responded by calling the claim "ridiculous" and "baseless." She added: "If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a mere fraction of what's been reported." We are keeping this as unverified since the claim has a lifespan of one week and it will be proven true or false by Friday.
